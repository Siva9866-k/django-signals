Question 1: Are Django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously by default?
Answer:
Django signals are executed synchronously by default.

from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
import time

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def my_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal handler started")
    time.sleep(5)  
    print("Signal handler finished")
