 Question 3: Do Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller?
Answer:
Yes â€” if the signal is emitted inside a transaction, it runs in the same transaction unless you explicitly use @transaction.on_commit.
#code
# signals.py
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.db import connection
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def my_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal inside transaction:", connection.in_atomic_block)
